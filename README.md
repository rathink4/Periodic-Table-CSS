# Periodic-Table-CSS

A simple project which was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and CSS Grid.
As the repo name suggest, I made this project for practicing CSS Grid and getting used to some CSS effects as well.

## Using the Repository

Git clone the repository and then `cd pt-app` into project directory; then you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
